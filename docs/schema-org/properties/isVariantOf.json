{"label":"isVariantOf","comment":"Indicates the kind of product that this is a variant of. In the case of <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"/ProductModel\">ProductModel</a>, this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"/ProductGroup\">ProductGroup</a>, the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"/ProductGroup\">ProductGroup</a>, this property can apply to any <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"/Product\">Product</a> included in the group.","supersedes":null,"supersededBy":null,"partOf":null,"id":"https://schema.org/isVariantOf"}
