{"label":"dateline","comment":"A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline\">dateline</a> is a brief piece of text included in news articles that describes where and when the story was written or filed though the date is often omitted. Sometimes only a placename is provided.<br/><br/>\n\nStructured representations of dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"/locationCreated\">locationCreated</a> (which represents where a work was created, e.g. where a news report was written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"/contentLocation\">contentLocation</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nDateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: \"BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.\", \"Paris, France\", \"December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington\", \"Beijing/Moscow\", \"QUEZON CITY, Philippines\".","supersedes":null,"supersededBy":null,"partOf":null,"id":"https://schema.org/dateline"}
