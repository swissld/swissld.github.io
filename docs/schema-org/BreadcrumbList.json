{"label":"BreadcrumbList","comment":"A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.<br/><br/>\n\nThe <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"/position\">position</a> property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a BreadcrumbList. The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"/itemListOrder\">itemListOrder</a> of <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"/ItemListOrderAscending\">ItemListOrderAscending</a> (lower values listed first), and that the first items in this list correspond to the \"top\" or beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage. The specific values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning with '1' for the first item in the list.","subTypeOf":["https://schema.org/ItemList"],"subTypes":null,"properties":["https://schema.org/additionalType","https://schema.org/alternateName","https://schema.org/description","https://schema.org/disambiguatingDescription","https://schema.org/identifier","https://schema.org/image","https://schema.org/itemListElement","https://schema.org/itemListOrder","https://schema.org/mainEntityOfPage","https://schema.org/name","https://schema.org/numberOfItems","https://schema.org/potentialAction","https://schema.org/sameAs","https://schema.org/subjectOf","https://schema.org/url"],"supersedes":null,"supersededBy":null,"partOf":null,"id":"https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList"}
